            <h4>What Was Asked</h4>
            <p>The clients needed a unique identity to establish their newly formed group. For this, they envisaged a mascot that could serve as the face of the band. This mascot was to be a spheroid blob shaped figure so that it could some day be fashioned into a helmet for BassFoundry's live performances or be easily animated for the background at larger venues. Additionally, It was important for this graphic to be easily printed on merchandise that the duo intended to sell/distribute as part of their regular gigs.</p>

            <h4>Figuring out the Visual Language</h4>
            <p>Or rather, how I learned to love my new Surface Book.</p>
            <p>I spent hours on the thing trying to figure out how to work with the surface pen. And somewhere down the line, I found I could do pencil sketches nearly as that on paper, on it. Henceforth, I took time out to learn the capabilities of the pen additionally to create artwork.</p>
            <p><i>And that's how I rediscovered Photoshop</i></p>
            <p class="tinyText">These sketches were done on a Surface Book with a Surface Pen.</p>

            <h4>Making it Pixel Perfect</h4>
            <p>Vectorising the artwork was more trouble than simply illustrating it within Photoshop with its sketchy linework. Plus, that gradient in the mouth was too difficult to render as a vector element. This took a while to figure out but I found the best solution to blend different offset containers within the artwork. Once that was done, I could recreate the artwork at multiple scales on demand.</p>
            <p>For now, this project stands as is. I'm hoping to convince BassFoundry to let me have a crack at designing the helmet ;)</p>
