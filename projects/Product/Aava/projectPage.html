                <h4>Concept</h4>
                <p>This one was a no-brainer. Shobhana and I had worked previously on a similar challenge for Fiama di Wills' shower gel packaging. We joked about how we could probably start our own firm <i>Batli Design</i> if we win this one, and we were pretty confident that we had a fair chance to.</p>
                <p>We decided to follow the same design process as the last time and provide a solution that was comprehensive (not just do the packaging but also reinterpret the brand). With Fiama di Wills, we weren't allowed to change the logo or any other brand visual mark that accompanied the shower gel line-up. With Aava, there was an obvious problem with the current brand language and without it, we couldn't go about designing new packaging. So, we reset our own brief and tackled the logo and brand language first.</p>

                <h5>Packaging</h5>
                <p>We started researching what other brands in this category were doing and found that there were hardly any competitors in the Indian market who were selling packaged water in glass bottles. This was odd. It meant that we could not do a competitor analysis to guide our design decisions. Not a problem though, there must be international brands, right?</p>
                <p>Of course, a quick google search will reveal brands like Perrier, Voss, Evian etc. as global players who sell premium mineral water in glass bottles much like what Aava intends to do. We quickly checked off a couple of aspirational qualities that the bottles and brands embodied: they were all strongly suggestive of mountain springs or similar landscape and a lot of them drew inspiration from the form of wine bottles (notable exception: Voss).</p>
                <p>Good, so we get what Aava could be in the Indian market, an aspirational brand of water like a Perrier or Evain. That leaves only our already accounted for, mammoth in the room: their visual language is not befitting such an aspirational brand. Sigh.</p>

                <h4>Brains & Storms 2</h4>
                <p>After going through some more brainstorming, (read: throwing words and doodles on a whiteboard hoping something would pop)we decided we have enough ideas to try creating a new visual identity for Aava. So, while I started with figuring out the math of developing bottles in Rhino, Shobhana did a tonne of more research on the mineral water industry's packaging. Somewhere in the middle of all this chaos, we found a typeface that completely changed our perspective.</p>
                <p>We'd been wanting to capture the same essence of the mountains by using the natural peaks and valleys of the letters A A V A. But that's what almost everyone was doing! From Evian, to Himalaya, all the mineral water bottles we'd seen had some mountains in their visual mark. Long story short, we needed to do something different to stand out and the typeface offered exactly that, the letter a was shaped almost like a droplet. That renders three droplets in the brand's name Aava.</p>
                <p>This serendipitous discovery gave us a clear direction for the rest of the design solution. We were going to imprint the form of the droplet in as many ways possible so as to create a unique brand identity that could carry across visual media. Also, we decided to (more or less) retain the green from the original brand logo.</p>

            <h4>Vector Graphicking</h4>
            <p>Having a visual direction, we went a little crazy on ideas for how we could transform the type into a visual motif. We found tesselations to be a great way of varying the visual character of the type into a larger pattern. So, with the help of a little Alt-J, we came up with a variety of tesselating tiles based on the original logotype. </p>
            <p>Also, we fixed on a variant of Avenir as the typeface for all body text. Having reached here, it was now easier to develop the packaging graphics as per the client's needs. We used the droplet as the visual mark and embedded all of the necessary information into it. (I'm not attaching the labels we created though)</p>

                <h4>Grasshopper Alert</h4>
                <p>While Shobhana was creating the assets for the packaging graphics, I'd made some progress in realising the droplet shape using some quick math. Essentially, the droplet could be modelled using a single Bezier curve drawn from the edge of the mouth of the bottle (which was fixed because of manufacturing constraints) and some point in space that could enclose the required volume. Here's a breakdown of the limiting specifications:</p>
                <p class="listed">1. Bottles will be in two variants: 750 ml and 300 ml<br> 2. Their heights must not exceed 280 mm<br> 3. Their girth will not exceed 85 mm in diameter<br> 4. The cap will be a standard aluminium cap (usually 28mm)<br> 5. The bottles will enclose a volume of 775ml and 330 ml approx in total (filled to the brim)<br> 6. They must not weigh more than 460 gms (I forget the exact number)</p>
                <p>These constraints reminded me of the one time I'd used a genetic solver in Rhino's grasshopper plugin to rapidly reiterate my design. So that's exactly what I did. We fed some variables into the model and voila! highly optimised designs were baking in no time. I stopped the solver every now and then to find a new variant that both of us liked and let it optimise for a local minima again.</p>
                <p>I'm making the script and the rhino file available <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17dXtaPj572toI6cyx2jNvkojYLeujGMR">here</a> in case you want to check it for yourself. I've tried to keep it pretty self-explanatory but you might have to spend some time understanding my logic.</p>

            <h4>Telling a Story</h4>
            <p>For this we needed renders, visualisations on how we imagine the bottle being used and to give options as to how the tesselation might work if printed or embossed on to the glass bottle. I wish I could link the document we'd submitted but I'd have to confirm if its okay with Shobhana. Meanwhile, here are some visualisations that might help drive the point home. These renders were done in Keyshot 7. The perspective matching is a little off in the graphics showing the bottle in use. In retrospect, it would've been nicer to setup the virtual cameras perfectly. I might update these later. </p>
