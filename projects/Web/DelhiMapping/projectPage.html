            <h4>A Brief History of Time</h4>
            <p>This started as a fun side project with Uttiya Bhattacharya while I was at Design business Collaborative circa 2015. He'd spent some time digitizing the INTACH database with exact geocodes instead of the physical maps they had available at that time. In this age of digital mapping solutions, we had with us, a wealth of public data that was difficult to access and ready to be deployed to the internet in an intuitive interface. </p>
            <p>We wanted to build a map application that could help you find/enjoy/visit/document these monuments. Enter Mapbox, and within a few weeks, we were able to build a little prototype that we could use to test. (An old implementation is embedded below)</p>
            <p>Cutting a long story short, I'd forgotten about this until our data visualisation module at NID Bangalore. So, I set about trying to gather some insight on the old database we'd used to create the first prototype.</p>

                    <h4>A quick note about INTACH</h4>
                    <p><b>INTACH</b> is short for <b>The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage</b> is a non-profit charitable organisation registered under the Societies' Registration Act, 1860. The organisation aims to stimulate and spearhead heritage awareness and conservation in India. Over the years, INTACH has taken up restoration and protection of hundreds of monuments that fall outside the scope of the Archaeological Survey of India and other government agencies</p>
                    <p>As INTACH Delhi Chapter, it maintains an exhaustive listing of Delhi's heritage structures.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://www.intachdelhichapter.org/">link to Intach Delhi Chapter</a></p>
                    <p class="tinyText">The data for this visualisation was originally available on the INTACH Delhi website. It has since been published in a book: "Delhi, The Built Heritage: A Listing"</p>

            <h4>"I need more data"</h4>
            <p>There were two problems that we ran into when trying to validate the data we'd picked off the INTACH website.</p>
            <p class="listed">
                1. It was difficult to find the listed monuments despite the geo-coordinates and the descriptions. The text descriptions were just not enough and oft, our markers were slightly off.<br> 2. We didn't have any imagery for the items in the listing.</p>
            <p>This is where a little quick research at the NID library proved useful. The book titled <i>"Delhi, The Built Heritage: A Listing"</i> was available and had pretty much all the data that the now defunct website didn't. So, I started entering this manually into my old database. A process that took the better part of a month. I'm linking the final dataset here (sans images though, I'm still working on high-resolution scans of the print material)</p>

            <h4>Classroom Exploration 1</h4>
            <p>This is one of the first exercises I did on the new Mapbox client. The colours are encoding the type of monument, on zooming in you can see its name and its importance (Historically, Architecturally or Archaeologically) coded as A B or C, where A is highly important, B is lesser, and you get the drift. Sorry about not having legends, I'm currently reworking this project.</p>

                <h5>Process Sketches: Layout</h5>
                <p>The very first thing to solve is the size of the actual map element of the visualisation with respect to the rest of the elements. Not knowing the sizes of the other elements, I decided to quickly iterate through a couple of variations on a sidebar + main visualisation space<br><br>
                    <b>Observations</b></p>
                <p class="listed">
                    1. Tooltips might work for the same reason as the first visualisation as they help users stay within the context and find information quickly. However, the <b>sheer volume of information to display makes tooltips impractical.</b> This will solve when the information schematic is more developed.<br><br> 2. <b>Legends and Filters</b> need to be solved individually before integration with the rest of the visualisation</p>

                <h5>Process Sketches: Map Layout</h5>
                <p>This one is easier because the map tool itself solves a lot of organisational problems. The timeline feature needs special attention. Also, the map needs to read differently at different zoom levels - Clustered at high zoom levels and be able to display individual structures at closer zoom.<br> The <b>glyphs themselves pose a problem</b>. Using glyphs makes the map extremely hard to read but on closer zoom levels, buildings do not have enough character to make visual distinctions easy.</p>

            <p>This step is the densest in terms of information to be displayed and needs some kind of bucketing to display the various kinds of information that are relevant.

            <h4>Proposed Interactions</h4>
            <p>Just trying my hand at building quick UIs in Photoshop to illustrate user journeys. One obvious problem jumps to attention with the very first visualisation: that the granularity of data is lost. For the final visualisation, I intend to rectify this by filtering data points as per the needs of different narratives. That should solve the problem of density of the scatterplot without having to bucket the items.</p>
            <p>Also, these screens aren't my favourites either. I was exploring a grungy old-school aesthetic that would work like an old map you'd find in a thrift shop. Clearly, much fail. Expect a new look for the final visualisation whenever it happens</p>
